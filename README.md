# About Me

## Before GA:
I studied Music at Fort Lewis College in beautiful Durango, CO, and while it was everything I could have ever wanted, I needed money to survive, so I took to serving tables and bartending. I learned some soft skills along the way: supervising, training new employees, effective inter- and intra-departmental communication, upholding company standards, and technological customer support. My most recent job at TopGolf involved instructing guests through the (very poorly designed and maintained) game software &mdash; the shortcomings in the software I dealt with inspired my desire to learn to code.

## Outcomes support I need:
 Interview Practice--whiteboard, confidence in talking to people. 

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Learn as much as possible.

## Two Truths and a Lie

1. I once broke into a VIP area of a club with a female friend and stole a Whole Foods chantilly cake, which we proceeded to eat in its entirety in
a stall in the mens bathroom. 
2. Before this class, I built a functional web app with MongoDB, Express, and Node. 
3. The Citra stain of hops triggers deeply religious experiences in my brain, so while I love IPAs, I stay away from them to avoid exhibiting
profound spiritual behaviors in public.

## Meetups I've attended:
1. Denver Script (6/27/2017), CSS Grid and Lambda
2. Denver Script (7/25/2017), Glitch and Debugging Pro-tips

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I'm not entirely sure yet. I like the idea of working as the sole in-house developer for a company, so that I can have a hand in the design and implementation of software. But, the stability of an agency sounds like what my finances need at this point in my life. 

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Nick and I seem kind of similar in that we're both interested in having a part in both design and code implementation. I don't have a solid
background in design, but I know fundamantals and can work efficiently in Affinity Designer, Illustrator, and Sketch.
