# About Me

## Before GA:
I studied Music at Fort Lewis College in beautiful Durango, CO, but it left me in the dust along with my annoying and needy friend, Student Loans.
I needed a job to make money, and what I wanted to do in music wasn't going to work financially unless I got some miraculous break. So, I took to 
the serving tables and bartending for a few years. I learned some soft skills along the way: supervising, training new employees, effective
inter- and intra-departmental communication, upholding company standards, and technological customer support. My most recent job at TopGolf
involved instructing guests through the (very poorly designed and maintained) game software &mdash; the shortcomings in the software I dealt with on half-hourly basis inspired my desire to learn to code. While in college, I was the designated tutor for all levels of music theory, where I enjoyed teaching music theory principles and application in aural skills.

## Outcomes support I need:
I was the most socially-anxious, shy, and quiet bartender that ever lived. I'm pretty sure I just made tips by being endearingly gullible, smiley, and nice. 
TL;DR: Interview Practice--whiteboard, confidence in talking to people. 

## Day 1 Goals:
1. Learn as much as possible.

## Two Truths and a Lie

1. I once broke into a VIP area of a club with a female friend and stole a Whole Foods chantilly cake, which we proceeded to eat in its entirety in
a stall in the mens bathroom. 
2. Before this class, I built a functional web app with MongoDB, Express, and Node. 
3. The Citra stain of hops triggers deeply religious experiences in my brain, so while I love IPAs, I stay away from them to avoid exhibiting
profound spiritual behaviors in public.

## Meetups I've attended:
1. Denver Script (6/27/2017)
2. 

## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
I'm not entirely sure yet. I like the idea of working as the sole in-house developer for a company, so that I can have a hand in the design and implementation of software. But, the stability of an agency sounds like what my finances need at this point in my life. 

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
Nick and I seem kind of similar in that we're both interested in having a part in both design and code implementation. I don't have a solid
background in design, but I know fundamantals and can work efficiently in Affinity Designer (I'm not a fan of Adobe's subscription-based business
model) and Sketch.
